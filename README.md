^ The main interface and various product pages are complete for the front end, as well as the database setup and internal numerical logic (e.g. calculating monthly principal and interest for a mortgage). To avoid redundancy, not every function is complete; the connection between the front- and back- ends is fully working and the rest should in a similar way.

Happy banking!
